#### This project is an attempt to provide a user-friendly desktop based on Sway - a popular tiling window manager (compositor) using the modern Wayland graphics stack. Ubuntu Sway Remix is great for both beginners who want to get familiar with the keyboard-oriented interface of tiling window managers and advanced GNU/Linux users who want a powerful, user-friendly and minimalistic interface. Ubuntu Sway contains popular console-based applications and utilities (CLI) along with graphical user interface (GUI) applications to meet the needs of most users.

* No Snap's!
* Very cool tiling Wayland compositor with amazing community
* Lightweight, easy to install, simple to use
